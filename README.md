# ViktorKolev.dev - frontend

The frontend for my future website.

## Blog

Here I'll be posting updates regarding my life, art, projects and other things I find interesting. I'll be making a TMU (Tri-Monthly Update) every three months as a large update featuring the following:

- A summary of the projects I've done in those three months.
- At least one painting and piece of writing I've done in the last three months.
- A life update with pictures (what I've done, where I've gone, stuff like that).
- Top 5 songs and movies for the last three months.

## Projects

Where I'll list all of my projects, along with descriptions. Clicking on one of them, you can view a page entirely dedicated to the project along with a markdown description.

## About Me

More information about me and what I do.

## Portfolio

My portfolio (same information as the website, but displayed in a more professional manner).
