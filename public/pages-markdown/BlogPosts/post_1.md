### RESIDENT EVIL 5 IS GREAT!

RE5 is a great addition to the games - i don't care what anybody says! Ofcourse it's not even a top 5 Resident Evil game - Top 5 RE games (objectively) are:

1. Resident Evil HD Remake
2. Resident Evil 2 (Original)
3. Resident Evil 7
4. Resident Evil 3
5. Resident Evil 4 (Original)

BUT! don't let that fool you - Resident Evil 5 is still one of the best CO-OP experiences you can have. It's goofy at times, but the atmosphere is still creepy, has a great soundtrack, the graphics hold up even in today's ridiculous world, there are a lot of unlockables which make the game replayable.

The Mercenaries - oh.my.GOD! How many hours I've sunk into the Games for Windows Live version of RE5 just because of The Mercenaries...

Also, I've practically speedran the game before I even knew what speedrunning is! My best time was under 4h (something like 3h30mins) while my previous runs were around 5h. Sadly, I never got near the world record, which is a whopping 1h41m44s on Veteran... Crazy...
