# RESIDENT EVIL 5 IS GREAT!

RE5 is a great addition to the games - i don't care what anybody says! Ofcourse it's not even a top 5 Resident Evil game - Top 5 RE games (objectively) are:

1. 1 - Resident Evil HD Remake
2. 2 - Resident Evil 2 (Original)
3. 3 - Resident Evil 7
4. 4 - Resident Evil 3
5. 5 - Resident Evil 4 (Original)

BUT! _don't let that fool you_ - Resident Evil 5 is still one of the best CO-OP experiences you can have. It's goofy at times, but the atmosphere is still creepy, has a great soundtrack, the graphics hold up even in today's ridiculous world, there are a lot of unlockables which make the game replayable.

**The Mercenaries** - oh.my.GOD! So, so many hours sunk into the Games for Windows Live version of RE5 just because of The Mercenaries...

Also, I've practically speedran the game before I even knew what speedrunning is! I was replaying the game, actively trying to beat it as fast as possible. My best time was under 4h (something like 3h30mins) while my previous runs were around 5h. Sadly, I never even got near the world record, which is a whopping 1h41m44s _on Veteran difficulty_... **Crazy...** (Of course I was like 9, 10 or 11 back then, so it's understandable)
