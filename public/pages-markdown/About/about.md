## Programming

I try to keep myself busy with projects pretty much all the time. You can find them in my Projects page and on GitHub.

| Frontend              | Backend | Popular stuff I've utilized               |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| HTML/CSS              | Java    | Firebase (hosting, auth, data)            |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | Python  | ThreeJS (rednering 3D Models in websites) |
| React                 |         | TailwindCSS, Bootstrap (CSS libraries)    |
| ThreeJS               |         | Remarkable (Markdown Parsing)             |

And there are other essentials I've used - npm, vite, git, etc. and I'm learning Java at the moment, which means the list is only expandi further with different tech.

## Music

I was going to do Top 5 albums, songs and musicians, but it was TOO HARD! Here are my favourites.

###### Note: the lists below are not ranked in any way, they are all number ones in my opinion - as with other lists on this page

| Favourite albums                                           | Favourite bands/musicians |

| Black Sabbath - Master of Reality                          | Type O Negative           |

## Books

I try to read books as often as possible - my goal is to keep it at least one book a month. I wouldn't call myself a bookworm, I just love learning about different topics and collecting the books which have helped me do so. Same thing goes for a few comic books, as I find them both a good read and simply very cool. Fiction and non-fiction, I just love opening my mind to different ideas.

###### Note: To be clear - I've read other books/comics besides these ones lol. I just wouldn't say they fall into the "favorite" category.

| Favourite Books                                                | Favourite comic books (will put manga here) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Anything by H. P. Lovecraft                                    | Star Wars: Kanan                            |
| Unscripted: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Entrepreneurship | Star Wars: Darth Vader (Charles Soule)      |
| 1984                                                           | Berserk                                     |

## Games

I love video games, TCGs and board games. Magic The Gathering is basically an addiction of mine, as I'm sitting at around 10+ decks for around 5 formats of the game...

| Favourite video games | Favourite board games      | Favourite TCGs           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Minecraft             | Elder Sign                 | Magic The Gathering      |

| Counter-Strike        | Nemesis                    | Sorcery: Contested Realm |
| Cyberpunk 2077        | God of War (The Card Game) |                          |
| Resident Evil (any)   | Tiny Epic Dungeons         |                          |

## PC

I decided to share my build, as I found this to be the most cost-efficient quality PC parts for 1440p 144hz 144fps gaming. I use a 3440x1440p curved 34inch OLED monitor, so I need a beefy machine.

###### Note: I'm sadly running windows at the moment, as I play CS on Faceit + Easy Anti Cheat doesn't work on Linux. My beast of a laptop (a very old second-hand Lenovo Thinkpad) has Arch Linux installed and it keeps up with my PC for coding and work stuff. Some time in the future I'll install a double boot on my PC for Arch x Windows.

| PC part     | Spec                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| CPU         | AMD Ryzen 5 9600x             |
| GPU         | Radeon RX 9070 XT             |
| RAM         | Kingston 32GB DDR5            |
| Motherboard | GIGABYTE B650 EAGLE AX        |
| PSU         | Corsair RM1000e               |
| SSD         | Samsung 990 PRO (MZ-V9P1T0BW) |
| Cooler      | Noctua NH-D15S                |
