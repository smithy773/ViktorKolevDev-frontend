# Programming

I try to keep myself busy with projects pretty much all the time. You can find them in my Projects page and on GitHub.

| Frontend              | Backend | Popular stuff I've utilized               |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| HTML/CSS              | Java    | Firebase (hosting, auth, data)            |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | Python  | ThreeJS (rendering 3D Models in websites) |
| React                 |         | TailwindCSS, Bootstrap (CSS libraries)    |
| ThreeJS               |         | Remarkable (Markdown Parsing)             |
|                       |         | JavaFX                                    |

And there are other essentials I've used - npm, vite, git, etc. and I'm learning Java at the moment, which means the list is only expanding further with different tech.

# Music

I was going to do Top 5 albums, songs and musicians, but it was TOO HARD! Here are my favourites.

###### Note: the lists below are not ranked in any way, they are all number ones in my opinion - as with other lists on this page

| Favourite albums                                           | Favourite bands/musicians |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |

| Queens of the Stone Age - Songs for the Deaf               | Dave Matthews             |
| Black Sabbath - Master of Reality                          | Type O Negative           |
| Daughter - Music from Before The Storm                     | Massive Attack            |

# Books

I try to read books as often as possible - my goal is to keep it at least one book a month. I wouldn't call myself a bookworm, I just love learning about different topics and collecting the books which have helped me do so. Same thing goes for a few comic books, as I find them both a good read and simply very cool. Fiction and non-fiction, I just love opening my mind to different ideas.

###### Note: To be clear - I've read other books/comics besides these ones lol. I just wouldn't say they fall into the "favorite" category.

| Favourite Books                                                | Favourite comic books (will put manga here) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Anything by H. P. Lovecraft                                    | Star Wars: Kanan                            |
| Unscripted: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Entrepreneurship | Star Wars: Darth Vader (Charles Soule)      |
| 1984                                                           | Berserk                                     |

# Movies / Shows

Movies and TV Shows are a great way to spend your time, especially when eating / snacking. My favourite movies and shows always talk about manhood, love and navigating your way between them (literally each movie and shows below includes those topics one way or another).

###### Note: Freaks and Geeks is probably top 3 best seasons of television made, House M.D. is THE best show ever, TMNT 2003 are THE best turtles and if each person wants to learn about manhood and can only watch one single movie to do so, it has to be Dead Poets Society - you can't argue with these statements, I simply will not believe you if you don't think I'm right :p

| Favourite movies   | Favourite shows                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Dead Poets Society | House M.D.                          |
| 50/50              | Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003) |
| Stand By Me        | The Sopranos                        |
| Fight Club         | Supernatural                        |
| Hesher             | Freaks and Geeks                    |

# Games

I love video games, TCGs and board games. Magic The Gathering is basically an addiction of mine, as I'm sitting at around 10+ decks for around 5 formats of the game...

| Favourite video games | Favourite board games      | Favourite TCGs           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Minecraft             | Elder Sign                 | Magic The Gathering      |
| The Binding of Isaac  | The Binding of Isaac       | Flesh and Blood          |
| Counter-Strike        | Nemesis                    | Sorcery: Contested Realm |
| Cyberpunk 2077        | God of War (The Card Game) |                          |
| Resident Evil (any)   | Tiny Epic Dungeons         |                          |

# PC

I decided to share my build, as I found this to be the most cost-efficient quality PC parts for 1440p 144hz 144fps gaming. I use a 3440x1440p curved 34inch OLED monitor, so I need a beefy machine.

###### Note: I'm sadly running windows at the moment, as I play CS on Faceit + Easy Anti Cheat doesn't work on Linux. My beast of a laptop (a very old second-hand Lenovo Thinkpad) has Arch Linux installed and it keeps up with my PC for coding and work stuff. Some time in the future I'll install a double boot on my PC for Arch x Windows.

| PC part     | Spec                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| CPU         | AMD Ryzen 5 9600x             |
| GPU         | Radeon RX 9070 XT             |
| RAM         | Kingston 32GB DDR5            |
| Motherboard | GIGABYTE B650 EAGLE AX        |
| PSU         | Corsair RM1000e               |
| SSD         | Samsung 990 PRO (MZ-V9P1T0BW) |
| Cooler      | Noctua NH-D15S                |
